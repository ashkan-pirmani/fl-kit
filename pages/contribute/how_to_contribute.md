## Read the guides

Before starting editing on GitHub:
1. Make sure you are following our [style guide](style_guide).
2. Follow the structure of the provided template for the page you wish to create or update.
3. We use markdown. To learn how to create paragraphs, headings, format text, add links and images and much more, follow our [markdown cheat sheet]({{site.WEBSITE}}/markdown_cheat_sheet).
4. Our pages contain metadata. Read more about them in our [page metadata guide](page_metadata).

## Linking resources and other pages (optional)
* If you have mentioned tools or resources in your text, you will have to add them to the [tool and resource list](tool_resource_update).
* If you want to list training material or link to other FLkit pages, add it to the page metadata. Read more on how to do this in our [page metadata guide](page_metadata).

## Example page

This page [sample page](sample_page) demonstrates the types of metadata and links a page can include.

## Acknowledgement and ownership of content

Contributors will be shown at the bottom of each page and on the main [contributors page]({{site.WEBSITE}}/contributors) if listed in the metadata of the markdown file. We strongly suggest to add the name, ORCID, email address and/or GitHub account and affiliation of the contributor to the [CONTRIBUTORS file]({{site.REPO}}/CONTRIBUTORS.yaml).

No single contributor or editor owns the site's content or has the right to dictate what the content should be. The content on the FLkit is community-led, with many people contributing to each section. Hence, decisions are driven by consensus among the contributors and editors.

Since content is periodically updated, others may change your contribution without notifying you. However, the FLkit editors ensure that content is only modified for good reasons, ensuring that all legitimate concerns and different points of view are accommodated and that the content reflects the most popular consensus on any given topic.

If you find any content unsatisfactory, please feel free to [create an issue]({{site.REPO}}/issues/new/choose) about it.
